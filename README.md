##Create a C++ application to read, write, and append data to text files.
This task focuses on showcasing file-handling techniques.##

The objective of this task is to help you understand how files are managed in C++. By building this application, you will learn how to use file stream classes to open, read, write, and modify files. These capabilities allow programs to interact with stored data and perform persistent operations, meaning the data remains accessible even after the program terminates. Mastering file operations is essential for software development in any domain.

#Task Requirements#
You are required to create a console-based C++ application that performs the following operations:

*Read from a File*:
Your program should allow users to open a text file and display its contents. This helps in understanding how to use input file streams (ifstream) in C++. It should handle situations where the file might not exist and inform the user accordingly.

*Write to a File*:
The application should include functionality to create a new file or overwrite an existing one. The user should be able to input text that will be saved in the file. This operation will help you understand how output file streams (ofstream) are used in write mode.

*Append to a File*:
Apart from reading and writing, your program should also allow users to add content to the end of an existing file without erasing the previous content. This is done using append mode (ios::app), and is crucial for applications like logging, journaling, and data tracking.

##Technical Learning Outcomes##

By completing this task, you will gain hands-on experience with the following concepts:
File stream classes (fstream, ifstream, ofstream)
File open modes (ios::in, ios::out, ios::app)
Reading and writing strings and characters to files
Error handling during file operations (e.g., checking if a file is open)
Structuring programs using functions
Console-based user interaction and input validation
